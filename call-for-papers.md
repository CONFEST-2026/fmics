## Call for papers
Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems (FMICS) 31st International Conference, co-located with CONFEST  
2 - 4 September 2026  
University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK



### Theme of the Conference:
The aim of the FMICS conference series is to provide a forum for researchers an practitioners who are interested in the development and application of formal methods in industry. FMICS brings together scientists and engineers who are active in the area of formal methods and interested in exchanging their experiences in the industrial usage of these methods. The FMICS conference series also strives to promote research and development for the improvement of formal methods and tools for industrial applications. 

FMICS is the ERCIM Working Group conference on Formal Methods for Industrial Critical Systems, and it is the key conference in the intersection of industrial applications and Formal Methods. 


### Topics of Interest:
We encourage submissions on cross-cutting approaches that bring together formal methods and industrial applications.
 - Formal specification, including specification elicitation, validation, debugging, sanity checking, revision, coverage, and explainability. 
 - Case studies and experience reports on industrial applications of formal methods, focusing on lessons learned or identification of new research directions. 
 - Methods, techniques, and tools to support automated analysis, certification, debugging, learning, optimization, and transformation of complex, distributed, real-time, embedded, mobile, and autonomous systems.
 - Verification and validation methods (model checking, theorem proving, SAT/SMT constraint solving, abstract interpretation, etc.) that address shortcomings of existing methods with respect to their industrial applicability (e.g., scalability and usability issues, tool qualification, and certification).
 - Transfer to industry and impact of adoption of formal methods on the development process and associated costs in industry. Application of formal methods in standardization and industrial forums.
    

### Important Dates:
 - Abstract Submission: 10 Apr 2026
 - Paper Submission:    17 Apr 2026
 - Paper Notifications:  1 Jun 2026
 - Camera-ready Papers: 15 Jun 2026
 - Conference:         2-4 Sep 2026


### Submission Details:
Papers must describe original research work and results. Submitted papers must not have previously appeared in a journal or conference with published proceedings and must not be concurrently submitted to any other peer-reviewed workshop, symposium, conference, or archival journal. Any partial overlap with any such published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated.

Submissions should clearly motivate relevance to industrial applications. Case study papers should identify lessons learned, validate theoretical results (such as scalability of methods), and provide specific motivation for further research and development.

Papers should not exceed 15 pages (excluding references) formatted according to the Springer author guidelines LNCS style. Any appendices (beyond the above page limit) might not be considered in the review process. All submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the Programme Committee, which will make a selection among the submissions based on the novelty, soundness, and applicability of the presented ideas and results. Papers must be written in English and submitted in PDF format at the EasyChair submission site:

[https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmics2026](https://easychair.org/conferences?conf=fmics2026)

For all papers with experimental results, we strongly recommend providing reviewers with an artifact that they can use to reproduce results, e.g., via a paper website. 

Following FMICS tradition, the paper with the best contributions to Software Science and Technology will be honoured with the EASST ERCIM award.


### Keynote Speakers:
 - Julia Badger, NASA Johnson Space Center
 - Colin O’Halloran, D-RisQ
